## General Testing Considerations

1. **Edge Cases**:
   - Test with minimum/maximum values
   - Test with empty/null values
   - Test with special characters

2. **Security Testing**:
   - Verify proper authorization
   - Test role-based access control
   - Test boundary conditions

3. **Integration Testing**:
   - Test interactions between modules
   - Verify end-to-end workflows

4. **Performance Testing**:
   - Test with large data sets
   - Test batch operations

5. **Error Handling**:
   - Verify clear error messages
   - Test recovery from error states

6. **Upgrade Testing**:
   - Test migration paths
   - Verify backward compatibility

## Implementation Notes

For each test case:
1. Initialize test environment
2. Set up any prerequisites
3. Execute the operation
4. Verify the expected outcome (success or expected failure)
5. Clean up test environment if needed

Test with multiple user roles:
- Admin users
- Regular users
- Unauthorized users
